Hello Professor,

I have attached our dataset and code here. Overall, it contains 3 Folders and 1 file.

Model folder contains all the files which we used in our local machine to preprocess the dataset - extracting frames from the videos and the extraction of landmarks further we trained the model and saved it in the same folder with the name Hybrid_hand_model.h5 (for processed_dataset, a shortcut has been added due to the data size being larger and this available in the notebook folder).

Software folder contains the same files as the Model folder which also includes the Realtime hand detection software, named as realtime_prediction.py. We can run the realtime_prediction.py directly as the folder already includes datasets , preprocessed dataset , landmarks and the hybrid_hand_model.h5. There is a demonstration video of our software under the name- Demonstration.mp4

As per your advice, we created a python notebook file under the notebook folder. So, you can find a .ipynb file and the other relevant folders in the same. In the python notebook file, the executed process will be available for viewing and reviewing our project.

Thank you for your guidance and support throughout our project term
